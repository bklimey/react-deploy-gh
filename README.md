# Instructions

> Some commentaries are generated by ChatGPT
1. On local machine, create a new react project using <br>
`npx create-react-app "react-deploy-gh"` (`"react-deploy-gh"` can be other name)
2. Navigate into folder <br>
`cd react-deploy-gh`
3. Setup Git for project <br>
    `git init`
    > Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, creating a new .git subdirectory that will contain all the version control information.
4. Create new empty repo called `react-deploy-gh` (can be other name) in Github
5. Commit and push local repo to Github <br>
    1. `git commit -m "first commit"`
    > Commits the changes made to the repository, creating a new snapshot of the code in its current state. The -m option allows you to add a message describing the changes made in this commit.
    2. `git branch -M main`
    > Renames the default branch from master to main. This is done to avoid using terminology with potentially racist connotations.
    3. `git remote add origin https://github.com/bklimey/react-deploy-gh.git`
    > Adds a remote repository named origin with the specified URL. The remote repository is typically hosted on a platform like GitHub or GitLab, and allows you to push your local changes to a central location that can be accessed by other contributors.
    > `bklimey` should be your Github username and `react-deploy-gh` should be your repo name.
    4. `git push -u origin main`
    > Pushes the changes to the main branch of the remote repository named origin. The -u option sets the upstream branch, so that future git push commands without specifying a branch will automatically push to the main branch of the origin remote.
